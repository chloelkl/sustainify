"The signup and login system has JSON Web Token (JWT) implemented and uses it to verify authenticity.
The session for each user is tracked and persistent unless the user logouts, meaning if the user or admin is not logged in, the user or admin will not see their respective pages like user main and admin main.
Implement a logout function in admin main and user main at the bottom of the admin logo, way below the bottom section.
Back to the admin sign up link, here's how it's gonna work, admins can only sign up for a admin account by a special sign up link from existing admins, the existing admins will have to go into system overview and click on 'Generate Admin Signup Link'. The newly generated link then displays beneath the button and has a button to the link's right side for quick easy access copy (aka copy to clipboard button). When the existing admin sends it to another person, that person can click on the link to bring them to AdminSignUp.jsx and it will look similar to signup.jsx but it should have a few words to indicate the page is for admin sign ups, additionally it needs to have another field to key in a one-time-password (OTP), on top of email and double password. This OTP can be generated at the same place that the signup link is generated, which is in existing admins' system overview, the box on the right of the generate link should have another 'Generate OTP' and the newly generated OTP should appear below with a copy to clipboard button, similar to the signup link.
By default, all visitors that login should be users, and they should see the userMain etc. For a admin to login, once they key in their email, it should be crosscheck with the database on whether this email is tied to an admin account, if it is, it should give this visitor the admin functionalities and admin main webpages etc. This means that during adminSignup.jsx, any accounts that are created using this link will have to tag a admin role to the email, allowing easy authentication for future admin logins."
